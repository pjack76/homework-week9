Node.js README Generator

The project is to generate an README.md file.  The README has title, description, usage of the project.  It also has instructions on how to install the project, the licensing, testing and contributing information.  The project prompts for gitHub username.  Then it would make an axios request to gitHub API to retrieve the user's avatar.  The avatar is then part of the generated README.md.  The generated README also has to generate gitHub badges (at least one).

For the most part, I got everything to work, except the images won't format in the generated README.
